Word is a tool for looking up word definitions.
It performs multiple lookups in public online dictionaries,
 cleans and compactifies the output.

It presently supports the following sources:
* wiktionary
* urban dictionary
* wordnet
* aonaware

Source dictionaries can be selected on the command line.
To view just translations, add -t
With -a, all dictionaries are chosen, not just the default ones.
